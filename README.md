# Nico Brew Co.

## Nico Brew Co.? What is that?

Well, it is a brewery. But not a real one. It's my home brewery. I am making beer, but not in a I'm selling it to bars and stuff, you get it. I guess it's as real as you want it to be ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## So, what are you looking at?

Well, I've been brewing my own brewery since may 2021, and I'm getting pretty good at it. I have been having fun chalenging myself making unusual and creative beers. Of course, I have classic blonde beers. But I also have a coffee beer, a more complex beer for those of us who like a nice buzz. Or a sake beer, which is on the umami side of the taste pallet. And some more fun brewing projects are coming out soon! But I'm not going to spoil it all for you, I'll let you check it all out on my platform üòâ

## So, why a website if I'm not selling them?

Well, I've been getting into web development lately. So it's the best time to showcase all the things I do and share my love for homebrewing. If there's one thing beer is good at, it's being there for the moments you share with family and friends. It makes sense that I would share my hobby with the world. You're starting to get it, it's all about sharing. And my homebrewery's website is part of that idea: a platform where you can rate beers, share an idea for a new beer recipe, ask for help for your own homebrewery, ‚Ä¶

## So, what's on this platform?

Obviously, there will be a beer section so people will be able to discover my beers and 

## Who did it and how?

I'm the front-end developer, and my friend Greg (believe it or not, he's not just a drinking buddy) will do the back-end stuff. He's been invested in my beer for a while, which is probably the main reason why he's friends with me.

Here's what we're using to do it:

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
