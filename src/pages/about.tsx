          Hey, I'm Nico.
          <br />
          I like beer. I like it so much, I started making it myself. Why call my brewery "Not A Brewery"? Well, I'm still only doing this for fun.
          <br />
          <br />
          As long as I'm having fun, why not make a website for my brewery? So here we are! Feel free to roam around, take a look at the beers I make, leave a comment, look at the more creative projects I'm doing, â€¦ You can even send me ideas! You never know when I'll run out of weird stuff to do. The weird idea to beat: a bacon and maple syrup beer.
